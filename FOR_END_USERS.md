## :vibration_mode: Gateway / Edge Stage
<p align="justify">Global Shared Learning: Classroom is an initiative that aims to link a course at the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey with a course at an associated international university, in this case the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Aeron√°utica (ITA), through an international element, using technological tools to connect with others students, foster collaboration and facilitate learning in multicultural environments.
Therefore, with the help of the international component, this course aims to demonstrate the main IoT foundations through the implementation of a digital system prototype that obtains data through sensors, processes it, and presents it on an Internet platform for later analysis and visualization.</p>

## :cloud: Cloud Stage
<p align="justify">A disaster is a sudden and unfortunate event that brings with it a great damage, loss, and destruction of local infrastructure. The WHO has defined it as "any sudden occurrence of events that cause damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, deterioration of health and health services, on a scale sufficient to waeeant an extraordinary response from outside the affected community or area".</p>

<p align="center" width="100%"><a name = "Disaster Management" href="https://youtu.be/9WIwlljva_s"><img src="https://github.com/ErnoMitrovic/WebSeekers/blob/main/fig/DisasterManagementCycle.jpg" alt="Disaster Management. Disasters: types and effects" width="65%"></a></p>

<p align="justify">Consequently, disaster management is extremely important to suriveve in the case of a major unfortunate evenet (natural or man-made). Therefore, this important concept can ve defined as the organisation aspects of emergencies through the application of response and recovery in order to lessen the impact.
For instance, if the local infrastructure is affected and there are no telecommunication resources, with a good disaster management, the essential communication resources coulde be provided in the response stage in order to supply a complete telecommunication infrastructure that provides Command and Control to support the operations.</p>
