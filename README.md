<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# üóÇÔ∏è About The Project <a name = "about-the-project"></a>

## Collaboration
Global Shared Learning: Classroom is an initiative that aims to link a course at the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey with a course at an associated international university, in this case the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Aeron√°utica (ITA), through an international element, using technological tools to connect with others students, foster collaboration and facilitate learning in multicultural environments.
Therefore, with the help of the international component, this course aims to demonstrate the main IoT foundations through the implementation of a digital system prototype that obtains data through sensors, processes it, and presents it on an Internet platform for later analysis and visualization.

## Scenario

A disaster is a sudden and unfortunate event that brings with it a great damage, loss, and destruction of local infrastructure. The WHO has defined it as "any sudden occurrence of events that cause damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, deterioration of health and health services, on a scale sufficient to waeeant an extraordinary response from outside the affected community or area". 

<p align="center" width="100%"><a name = "#itajai" href="https://youtu.be/9WIwlljva_s"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/an_webp/9WIwlljva_s/mqdefault_6s.webp?du=3000&sqp=CPfDvJsG&rs=AOn4CLAby3Xmb_gnpJlLiM-_xn1z-9OJUw" alt="Disaster Management. Disasters: types and effects" width="65%"></a></p>

Consequently, disaster management is extremely important to suriveve in the case of a major unfortunate evenet (natural or man-made). Therefore, this important concept can ve defined as the organisation aspects of emergencies through the application of response and recovery in order to lessen the impact.
For instance, if the local infrastructure is affected and there are no telecommunication resources, with a good disaster management, the essential communication resources coulde be provided in the response stage in order to supply a complete telecommunication infrastructure that provides Command and Control to support the operations.

## Solution

The problem to be answered by the Project is how to provide an efficient and secure environment to send a distress message when a natural disaster occurs (in our case, the flood disaster situation). In the scenario, there are no telecommunication links to provide essential communication (voice and data) to the rescue teams. Consequently, it is required to be innovative. It uses the means existent in the community and by volunteers, for example, [drones](https://safetymanagement.eku.edu/blog/5-ways-drones-are-being-used-for-disaster-relief/), to provide communication resources and support the identification of hazards.

In this scenario, victims in the flood area will have a smartphone with a rescue app, which enables the citizens to send their position continuously and when they are in danger (severity level message: high, medium, or low) as a basic text message (description of their situation). To provide communication support (enabling victims‚Äô messages to flow to the Crisis Management Center - CMC), drones flying in the crisis area intercept the message and forward it to other drones until the message arrives at the CMC. The CMC data is processed and aggregated, and a dashboard is provided for the operators to plan the rescue operation efficiently.

There you can see two groups of nodes (emulated and real nodes). The real node is an [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio) device, which sends periodically (you need to define the period) MQTT messages to the Application Server through the bridge brokers existent in the emulation, informing the **severity and position** of the user. On the other hand, the emulated nodes are **Python scripts** with the same functionality as the real ones.

There is an application server to provide the features to the Command-and-Control (C2) users. It is a real node that runs on a server box (Linux or Windows). This server has a Mosquitto broker, which receives all messages from the bridge ones and persists them in a SQL database. Also, it has a dashboard that organizes the data in a helpful format, presents the information in a map visualization, and calculates the Risk KPI (explained in the text).

We will use virtual interfaces in the emulation environment to enable the real and emulated nodes to exchange messages.

>As an user of the application I want the ability to send the SOS message even if I didn't have local internet connection. 
>- End user goal: Send SOS message.
>- End business goal: Track where users are in a disaster scenario.
>- Acceptance criteria: Send Message, User receives confirmation, Message is sent to the cloud, Admin receives the information on the Dashboard.
>- Measurement of success: Admin receive the location of the user in an inhospitable scenario.

>As an admin of the application I want to send confirmation messages to the users through the network. 
>- End user goal: Send confirmation message.
>- End business goal: Notify users that their message was received.
>- Acceptance criteria: Admin sends confirmation, cloud send to the mininet, user receives confirmation.
>- Measurement of success: User receives message confirmation in an inhospitable scenario

>As a helping organization I want to recieve SOS messages to operate quickly.
>- End user goal: recieve SOS messages.
>- End bussiness goal: operate quickly during a disaster scenario.
>- Acceptance criteria: Request SOS message, Server recieves the query, Drones interconnect to send the message, Message is send to the organization.
>- Measurement of success: Organization recieves the location of the user in an inhospitable scenario.


# üìù Planning <a name = "planning"></a>
## Sprint planning
All sprints are one week long. Sprint planning takes place at the beginning of the week.
## Sprint review and retro
Sprint review and sprint retro occur at the end of each week when deliverables are sent to professors.
